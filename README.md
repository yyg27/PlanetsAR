# PlanetsAR

**PlanetsAR** is a Unity-based Augmented Reality (AR) project that lets users visualize planets and the solar system directly in their real environment. 

-  Built as a small project with pre-existing assets for CEN451 - Introduction to Mixed Reality Applications Lecture
-   Built using Unity’s **AR Foundation** for cross-platform AR support (iOS / Android)
- This is just source code you need to build for yourself (see Installation)
    

## Technologies Used

-   **Unity** (Version: 2022.3.62f2 LTS)
    
-   **C#** 
    
-   **HLSL / ShaderLab** (for visual effects)
    
-   **AR Foundation / ARKit / ARCore**
    
-   **Platform:** iOS and Android (AR-compatible devices)
    

## Installation
